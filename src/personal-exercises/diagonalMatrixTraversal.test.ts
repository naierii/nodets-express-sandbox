describe("Diagonal Matrix Traversal", () => {
  // You are given an m x n matrix (a 2D array) of numbers. Your task is to write a Javascript
  // function called diagonalTraversal that takes this matrix as an argument and returns an
  // array containing all the elements of the matrix in diagonal order.
  //
  // Diagonal Order: Start from the top-left corner of the matrix, traverse the elements
  // diagonally upwards towards the right.
  // When you reach the right edge, move down to the next row
  // and continue traversing diagonally. If you hit the bottom or the left edge, reverse the
  // direction and continue.
